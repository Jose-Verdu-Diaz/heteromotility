Heteromotility is a tool for analyzing cell motility in a quantitative manner.
Heteromotility takes timelapse imaging data as input and calculates 70+
'motility features' that can be used to generate a 'motility fingerprint' for a
given cell. By analyzing more features of cell motility than most common cell
tracking methods, Heteromotility may be able to identify novel heterogenous
motility phenotypes.
