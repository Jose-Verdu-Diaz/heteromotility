Tutorial

Heteromotility consists of modular components:

1. Motility feature quantification with the ``heteromotility`` CLI
2. Subpath feature extraction with the ``heteromotility`` CLI
3. Unsupervised clustering analysis tools
4. Supervised classification tools
5. Detailed balance analysis by `N`-dimensional probability flux analysis

The following tutorials explore each of these components using simulated data sets.
A guided analysis of simulated data is also provided.
