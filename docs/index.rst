Heteromotility Documentation
==========================================

Heteromotility is a tool for analyzing cell motility in a quantitative manner. Heteromotility takes timelapse imaging data as input and calculates 70+ 'motility features' that can be used to generate a 'motility fingerprint' for a given cell. By analyzing more features of cell motility than most common cell tracking methods, Heteromotility may be able to identify novel heterogenous motility phenotypes.

Heteromotility also contains a suite of tools to quantify and visualize cell state spaces, and dynamic state transitions within the state space. While these tools were developed for use with Heteromotility features, they may be applied to any arbitrary time-series feature set.
